# What is this package about?
The Orbit Camera controller package contains a script providing functionality for a multi-purpose camera controller.\
The camera controller can be configured to replicate various types of camera movements based on a pivot object.\
It can automatically change height to match any surface and automatically zoom in and out to prevent clipping inside of level geometry.

# How do I install this package?

# How do I create an Orbit Camera?
The easiest way to create an Orbit Camera is to use an existing camera as a base.\
To **convert an existing camera** into an Orbit Camera you can use the **'Create Orbit Camera' context menu option of the camera component**.\

It's also possible to create an Orbit Camera **from scratch** using the **'GameObject/Orbit Camera' context menu option**.\
This will instantiate an Orbit Camera with its own camera component.\

# Configuring an Orbit Camera
The Orbit Camera can be configured on the OrbitCamera component **located on the pivot gameObject** of the camera setup.\
The settings are split into three categories, which are **movement**, **rotation** and **zoom**.

**Movement**\
![ControllerSettings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45980080/118819691-df4eb200-b8b5-11eb-988a-2ad974ec70bb.PNG)\
Of the movement settings the more interesting options to consider are the **'Surface Follow Type'** and **'Collision Detection'**\
These options change how the camera matches its height to the geometry its moving on.\
If **'Surface Follow Type'** is **'None'**, the camera controller **will not change its height** to match the level geometry.\
The colision detection changes, how the camera determines, when to adjust its height.\
If **'sweep test'** is selected, the camera will **only adjust its height if** the sweep test determines, thats the **pivot is inside of a collider**.\
Otherwise the camera will always change height to **match the heighest point inside of the 'Surface Check Range'**.

**Rotation**\
![ControllerSettingsRotation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45980080/118819737-ebd30a80-b8b5-11eb-9b39-b03ce75f80d0.png)\
Of the rotation settings the most interesting option is the **'Easing Behaviour'** which changes, when smoothing is to the rotation speed of the camera.\
**'Subtle'** means that smoothing is only applied, when the player is **not** holding the 'rotation button', allowing for a **smooth stop** of the camera rotation.

**Zoom**\
![ControllerSettingsZoom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45980080/118819791-f8576300-b8b5-11eb-8c00-5d1f9ae0cfc2.PNG)\
The zoom settings contain a **zoom range slider** which specified the **minimum** and **maximum zoom distance**.\
It also contains an options for **collision detection methods**, which **decide when the camera should avoid clipping into geometry**. \
If its set to **none**, the zoom will **never change to prevent clipping**.\
Set to **'Sweep Test'**, the camera will **only zoom in to prevent clipping, if its inside of a collider**.\
And if its set to **'Raycast from Center'**, it will zoom in, whenever a **collider is between the camera and its center**.
